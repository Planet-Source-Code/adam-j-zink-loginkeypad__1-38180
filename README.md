### Description

!Updated!It is a different of having a login dialog it resembles a high tech security system control panel you can set a limit to the char and if you make it into a ocx you can change the pass code still by looking in its propertys for caption

it can be either in a ocx or hidden in your code you choose and i am open to any surgestions

if you run the code you will see what i am talking about but i got the idea from the tv so technicly the tv should get the code, o yeah the pass code is 23446

thanks to stan amditis for your feed back

it now has "0" and a CLEAR key and it's perfect i hope but i am still open to feed back

!PLEASE VOTE FOR ME!
